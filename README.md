# Bank Customer Satisfaction Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction with a bank based on their survey responses. It involves analyzing both tabular data containing demographic information and ratings, as well as textual comments expressing customer opinions. By employing various classification techniques, we seek to automatically distinguish between satisfied and dissatisfied customers.

## Data Sources
- **Tabular Data:** `bank-tabular.csv` contains demographic details and rating scores.
- **Text Data:** `bank-comments.csv` comprises short textual comments reflecting customer sentiments.

## Tasks
### 1. Data Preparation
- Obtain the dataset from [this link](insert_link_here) and follow the instructions in the README.TXT file for data format.
- Preprocess the tabular data to address data quality issues and prepare it for analysis.

### 2. Data Characterizations
- Analyze, characterize, and summarize the cleaned tabular dataset, incorporating tables and visualizations.
- Explore temporal trends to understand how customer satisfaction levels evolve over time.

### 3. Tabular Data Classification
- Utilize the 'satisfied' variable to explore various classifiers for distinguishing between satisfied and unsatisfied customers.
- Quantify the performance of classification models using suitable evaluation strategies and discuss the results.

### 4. Text Data Classification
- Integrate textual comments data with tabular data after preprocessing.
- Employ different classifiers on the text data to classify customer responses.
- Assess and discuss the performance of classification models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### 5. Conclusions
- Compare the performance of tabular and text data representations for customer satisfaction classification.
- Summarize insights gained, challenges faced, and propose ideas for further analysis or classification on the dataset.
